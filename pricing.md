# Bolt.new Pricing and Usage

## Token System

### What are Tokens?

Tokens are the units of measurement used by AI models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet that powers bolt.new:

- **Definition**: Tokens are small chunks of text (roughly 4 characters in English)
- **Examples**: "I", "love", "programming" are each approximately one token
- **Processing Unit**: All AI interactions are measured in tokens for both input and output

### Token Consumption

Token usage in bolt.new is determined by several factors:

1. **Conversation Length**: Longer conversations use more tokens
2. **Project Complexity**: More complex applications require more tokens
3. **Code Volume**: Larger codebases consume more tokens
4. **Framework Choice**: Some frameworks require more explanation and code

### Approximate Token Usage by Task

| Task Type | Approximate Token Usage | Example |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| Simple Static Site | 5,000 - 15,000 | Basic HTML/CSS landing page |
| Interactive SPA | 20,000 - 50,000 | React app with few components |
| Full-Stack App | 50,000 - 150,000 | Next.js app with database integration |
| Complex Web App | 150,000+ | E-commerce site with authentication, payment |
