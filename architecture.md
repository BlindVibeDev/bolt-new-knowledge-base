# Bolt.new Architecture

## Overview

Bolt.new combines cutting-edge AI models with browser-based development capabilities through a revolutionary architecture. This document outlines the key components and how they work together.

## Core Components

### 1. WebContainers

WebContainers are StackBlitz's breakthrough technology that enables running Node.js environments directly in the browser:

- **WebAssembly-Based OS**: A virtualized operating system that runs entirely within the browser sandbox
- **Native Node.js Execution**: Allows Node.js to run directly in the browser for the first time
- **Virtualized TCP Network**: Mapped to the browser's ServiceWorker API, allowing server functionality
- **Filesystem Virtualization**: Complete virtual filesystem accessible through standard APIs
- **Performance Advantages**: Builds complete up to 20% faster than local, package installs 5x faster than yarn/npm

### 2. AI Integration

Bolt.new leverages Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model:

- **Real-Time Code Generation**: Generates functional, full-stack code based on natural language prompts
- **Environment Awareness**: The AI has comprehensive access to and control over the WebContainer environment
- **Self-Verification**: The AI can execute and verify its own code, making adjustments as needed
- **Contextual Understanding**: Maintains understanding of the entire project structure and state

### 3. Integration Layer

The sophisticated integration between WebContainers and Claude enables:

- **Bi-directional Communication**: The AI can both read from and write to the WebContainer environment
- **Stream Processing**: Real-time streaming of both AI responses and execution results
- **Command Execution**: AI can execute terminal commands, package installations, and server operations
- **Error Handling**: Sophisticated error detection and resolution

## Data Flow Architecture

1. **User Input**: Natural language prompt describing the desired application or feature
2. **AI Processing**: Claude analyzes the request and generates a development plan
3. **WebContainer Execution**: Code is executed in the WebContainer environment
4. **Feedback Loop**: Results are evaluated by the AI, which makes adjustments if needed
5. **UI Rendering**: The application is displayed in the preview window
6. **Iteration**: The user can provide further instructions to refine the application

## Security Architecture

- **Browser Sandbox**: All code execution occurs within the browser's security sandbox
- **No Remote Execution**: No code runs on remote servers, eliminating many security vulnerabilities
- **Data Privacy**: User code and data remain local to the browser session
- **Token Management**: Secure handling of authentication tokens and API keys
- **Permission-Based Access**: Controlled access to system resources

## Deployment Architecture

- **Netlify Integration**: One-click deployment to Netlify for production hosting
- **Configuration Generation**: Automatic generation of necessary deployment configurations
- **Build Process Management**: Handles build processes appropriate for the chosen frameworks
- **Deployment Verification**: Verifies successful deployment and provides access links

## Integration Points

### Supabase Integration

- Database creation and management
- Authentication services
- Storage solutions
- Real-time subscriptions

### Expo Integration

- Mobile application development
- Native component access
- Device simulation
- Build pipeline for mobile deployment

## Performance Considerations

- **Token Efficiency**: Architecture designed to minimize token usage for complex operations
- **Streaming Responses**: Immediate feedback through streaming response architecture
- **Caching Layer**: Intelligent caching of packages and dependencies
- **Progressive Loading**: Resources are loaded progressively as needed

## System Limitations

- **Browser Compatibility**: Primarily optimized for Chromium-based browsers
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited by available browser memory and processing capability
- **Network Dependency**: Initial loading requires internet connection (though operation can continue offline)
- **Token Limits**: Subject to model context window and token usage constraints

## Future Architecture Directions

- Enhanced multi-model AI collaboration
- Expanded framework support
- Improved performance optimization
- Advanced debugging capabilities
- Enhanced collaborative features
